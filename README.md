# Unsupervised ML for Market Segemention
 
In this project, I solved a customer segmentation problem of a bank, with the data of bankâ€™s customers for 6 months. The segmentation will help the bank launch a targeted marketing ad campaign that is tailored to specific group of customers, using unsupervised machine learning methods in Machine Learning. 

In the process, I completed the following steps:

-	Apply Python libraries, including seaborn, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib,  to import and visualize dataset images.
-	Understand the theory and intuition behind k-means clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA)algorithm.
-	Apply Scikit-Learn library to obtain the optimal number of clusters (K) using the elbow method
-	Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique to perform dimensionality reduction and data visualization
